## 🧠 How It Works

We use a custom-built AI system to pair students with their ideal residence based on preferences they provide. The engine consists of:

- Transformer-based **text embeddings** for preference matching  
- **Cosine similarity** to compare user input with scraped housing data  
- A **fine-tuned LLaMA 3 model** [trained here](https://github.com/james-yu2005/llama3-finetune) that generates a natural-language summary of the best-matched residence, describing room styles, location benefits, and bathroom types
